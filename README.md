# Simple example use about tools
Simple logic in C, python to GNU OS. We will work with this follow points:

1. [Header Files](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Header-Files.html)
2. [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
3. [Sort Algorithm](http://visualgo.net/sorting)
4. [Pointer](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointers.htm)
5. [Structures](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/gnu-c-manual.html#Structures)
6. [Program Arguments](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Program-Arguments.html)

### Triangle Calculator
This software will calculate the sides, perimeter and area of the triangle
from tree given points in the Cartesian plane. We will use to implement this
tree points: Header Files, Makefile and Structures.

### Sorting Integers
This is a program to command line. In this software you can use to sort a list
of given intergers. If you pass the flag -d or don't pass, will be crescent.
If you pass the flag -r, will be decreasing. We use Program Arguments and a
sort algorithm to make this software.

### Usage
To use this software you just need navegate to the directory, run the Makefike
and the bin will be created in the folder bin. See the follow example:
```sh
cd triangle_calculator/
make
./run
```
